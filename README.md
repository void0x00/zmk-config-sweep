# zmk-config

This is my personal [zmk-config](https://zmk.dev/) for my Split keyboards. <br />
Sweep Bluethooth(Nice!Nano) or Display Dongle(Xiao_ble), Studio available. <br />
Totem Dongle(Xiao_ble), Studio available.

## Modules

Additional features are provided by the following [modules](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/modules): <br />

- [**zmk-dongle-display**](https://github.com/englmaxi/zmk-dongle-display) to show the peripheral battery percentage (and more!) on the display of my dongle. <br />
- [**zmk-rgbled-widgets**](https://github.com/caksoylar/zmk-rgbled-widget) to show the connection and battery status with the built-in LEDs of the Xiao BLE controller. Based on this, the module was adapted in [led_indicator](boards/shields/led_indicator) to be used with the single LED of the nice!nano.
